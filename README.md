# About The Project | Proje Hakkında
**_English:_**

Hello. Just Run project is the first game project I made on Unity to try myself. The "V0.1.0 Alpha" and "V0.1.0 Beta" that you see in the commits are the first works I did years ago. For this reason, they are at a very bad level. I made the "V1.0.0.0" version you have seen in the past months and my goal was to bring Just Run, my first game project, to a level that can be called a game :D.

You can improve yourself by contributing to the Just Run project. Please feel free to contribute, you must have some great ideas for this game. Change what you want or add new things. Don't hesitate to do anything. You can use the project however you want, there are no restrictions. If you are going to use something from Just Run for commercial purposes, please give attribution.

For those who want to contribute to the project, the project is very straightforward. The code explains in detail what does what, and since Just Run is a beginner's project, it should take you about 5 minutes of browsing to grasp the project.  Unity Project Version: Unity2023.3.10
